# Roman to Integer

## Space Time Complexity

**Average**

O(N) time where n is the length of the input array. This is because we use a single loop that iterates over the entire array to calculate the integer from the roman numbers.

O(1) space since we don't use any additional space to find the accumulator

## Task

[Link to Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
